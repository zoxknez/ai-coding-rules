Follow MASTER_RULES.md.

Documentation rules:
- Use ATX-style headers (#, ##, ###).
- One sentence per line for better diffs.
- Use tables for structured comparisons.
- Include code examples with language hints.
- Keep README.md focused: purpose, install, usage, contribute.
- Use relative links for internal references.
- Add alt text to images.
- Update docs alongside code changes.
- Use emoji sparingly for visual hierarchy (🔴, ✅, ⚠️).
