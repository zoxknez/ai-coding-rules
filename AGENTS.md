# Agents

## Purpose
- Define how AI agents operate in this repo.

## Operating Rules
- Read project_profile.md and MASTER_RULES.md first.
- Use minimal diffs and avoid scope creep.
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous.
- Use tests to lock behavior before refactoring.
- Maintain an assumptions ledger (mark critical with 🔴).
- Follow the output contract: Assumptions → Plan → Patch → Verification → Notes.

## Update Policy
- After each completed task, update MEMORY_BANK.md with new decisions.

## Simplify Pass
- If a solution seems larger than necessary, run a simplify pass.
- Remove unnecessary abstractions while preserving correctness.
