# Frontend (TypeScript/React)

## Type Safety
- Ban `any`.
- Prefer `interface` where appropriate.

## React Style
- Functional components + hooks only.
- Avoid unnecessary state; prefer reducer/context for complex state.

## Exports
- Prefer named exports over default exports.

## Performance
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders; memoize only when justified.
