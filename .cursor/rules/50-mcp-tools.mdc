# MCP Usage

## When to Use MCP
- You need authoritative requirements (Jira/Linear/Trello).
- You need current PR/issue context (GitHub/GitLab).
- You need live schema or data (DB MCP).
- You need external docs or API references.

## Rule
- Fetch missing context before implementing.
- Cite the source of truth in notes.
