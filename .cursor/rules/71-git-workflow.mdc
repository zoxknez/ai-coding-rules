# Git Workflow Rules

## Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep subject line <72 characters
- Add body for complex changes

## Branch Naming
- `feature/` - new features
- `fix/` - bug fixes
- `refactor/` - code improvements
- `docs/` - documentation only

## Best Practices
- Commit early and often (checkpoints)
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Don't commit generated files
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change)
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Pull Requests
- Reference related issues
- Include testing instructions
- Keep PRs focused and reviewable
- Request reviews from relevant team members
