# Python / FastAPI

## Typing & Validation
- Use Pydantic v2 models for request/response schemas.
- Avoid raw dicts for external inputs.

## Async
- Use `async def` for I/O‑bound operations.
- Prefer `asyncpg` (or async‑capable drivers) for DB access.

## Style
- Prefer functions over classes unless stateful behavior is required.
