# Swift

> iOS feature modularization with ViewModel boundaries.

## Why This Structure

- Features colocate View, ViewModel, and Services.
- Core contains networking and security utilities.
- Resources stay isolated for predictable bundling.

## Files

- [structure.md](structure.md) — Canonical folder layout.
- [security.md](security.md) — Agent-induced vulnerabilities and fixes.
