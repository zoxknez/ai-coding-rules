# TypeScript

> Feature-sliced layout for Next.js and React.

## Why This Structure

- Features colocate UI, hooks, and actions.
- App router stays thin and routing-only.
- Schema-first types guide agent output.

## Files

- [structure.md](structure.md) — Canonical folder layout.
- [security.md](security.md) — Agent-induced vulnerabilities and fixes.
