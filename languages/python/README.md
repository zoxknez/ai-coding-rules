# Python

> Interface-first layout for FastAPI and Django projects.

## Why This Structure

- Pydantic schemas act as explicit contracts for agents.
- Services layer isolates business logic from transport concerns.
- Models layer keeps ORM details separate from schemas.

## Files

- [structure.md](structure.md) — Canonical folder layout.
- [security.md](security.md) — Agent-induced vulnerabilities and fixes.
- See [docs/security/AGENT_VULNERABILITIES.md](../../docs/security/AGENT_VULNERABILITIES.md) for cross-language patterns.
