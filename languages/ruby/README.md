# Ruby

> Rails-style boundaries with explicit service objects.

## Why This Structure

- Controllers stay thin and orchestration-only.
- Services encapsulate business logic.
- Policies centralize authorization.

## Files

- [structure.md](structure.md) — Canonical folder layout.
- [security.md](security.md) — Agent-induced vulnerabilities and fixes.
