> Modular layout for Node.js and React.

## Why This Structure

- Clear separation of routes, controllers, and services.
- Schemas enforce validation for agent output.
- Shared utilities stay isolated from features.

## Files

- [structure.md](structure.md) — Canonical folder layout.
- [security.md](security.md) — Agent-induced vulnerabilities and fixes.
