# PHP

> Laravel-style layering with explicit DTOs.

## Why This Structure

- Controllers stay thin and call services.
- Requests encapsulate validation rules.
- DTOs protect domain entities from overposting.

## Files

- [structure.md](structure.md) — Canonical folder layout.
- [security.md](security.md) — Agent-induced vulnerabilities and fixes.

## Sources

- Structure sources are listed in [structure.md](structure.md).
- Security sources are listed in [security.md](security.md).
