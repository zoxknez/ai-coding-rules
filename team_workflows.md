# Team Workflows for AI-Assisted Development (v2)

## PR template (recommended)
- Goal
- Success criteria checklist
- Scope / Non-goals
- Verification commands + screenshots
- Risks / rollout

## Branch strategy
- Small PRs, fast review
- Feature flags for risky changes

## Code review culture
- Reviewers focus on: correctness, scope, security, simplicity
- AI-assisted PRs require stricter discipline (diff budgets)

## Knowledge sharing
- Maintain a “prompt cookbook”
- Maintain “mistake log” (repeated AI failure patterns)
