   - Clear title
   - Description of the problem
   - Which file(s) affected
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 💡 Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for a new rule, pattern, or improvement?

1. **Open an issue** with `[Enhancement]` in the title
2. Describe:
   - The problem you're solving
   - Your proposed solution
   - Real-world example where it helped

### 🔧 Adding Stack Guides

We're looking for:
- Go

- Swift / iOS
- Kotlin / Android
- PHP / Laravel
- Ruby / Rails
- And more!

Use `stack_frontend.md` as a template.

### 🌍 Translations

Help make this accessible in more languages:
- Create a `/translations` folder if it doesn't exist
- Add your translation as `README.{lang}.md`
- Keep formatting consistent

### What Makes a Good PR

✅ **Good:**
- Specific, focused changes

## Style Guide

### Markdown Formatting

```markdown
# H1 for document title only
## H2 for major sections
### H3 for subsections

- Use bullet lists for items
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible

| Tables | For | Structured |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Data   | Like | This |

`inline code` for commands, file names, etc.

```language
code blocks for longer examples
```
```

### Writing Style

- **Be concise** — every word should earn its place
- **Be practical** — prefer "do this" over "consider doing"
- **Use examples** — show, don't just tell
- **Be specific** — "~200 LOC" is better than "keep it small"

### Emoji Usage

We use emojis sparingly for visual scanning:
- 🔴 Critical / Must do
- 🟡 Important / Should do
- 🟢 Good to have
- 🔵 Info / Reference
- ⚪ Optional
- ⭐ Highlight
- ⚠️ Warning
- ❌ Don't do
- ✅ Do this
