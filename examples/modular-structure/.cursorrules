# Root Rules (Minimal Global)
# Load for every file in project (~300 tokens)

## Core Principles
- Correctness > simplicity > consistency > style
- Minimal diff: touch only what's needed
- No drive-by refactors

## Non-Negotiables
- Ask when ambiguous (assumptions + max 3 questions)
- Stop on security, data loss, or breaking changes
- No secrets in code

## Output Format
1. Brief plan
2. Changes with file paths
3. Verification steps
